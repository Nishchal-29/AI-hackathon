INTRODUCTION\nMining has been a hazardous occupation. The history of mine accidents is a tragic and\nsobering reminder of the inherent risks associated with mining operations. Mining accidents\ncontinue to occur due to the complex nature of mining operations and the ever-present risks\nassociated with them. Throughout the centuries, mining accidents have claimed the lives of\ncountless miners and left lasting impacts on communities. Despite advancements in mine\nsafety, challenges persist. Factors such as human error, inadequate safety protocols,\ninadequate training, and unforeseen geological conditions can still lead to accidents.\nAdditionally, the mining industry's expansion into remote and challenging environments\npresents new risks and safety challenges that need to be addressed.\nSafety in Mining\nSafety in mines is of paramount importance and holds a significant place in the mining\nindustry. The primary objective of ensuring safety in mines is to safeguard the lives of\nminers. Mining operations can be inherently dangerous due to various factors such as\nunstable rock formations, underground gases, the presence of flammable materials, and heavy\nmachinery. The hazardous nature of mining operations necessitates strict adherence to safety\nprotocols and practices to protect the well-being of miners and prevent accidents.\nThe development of new technologies and safety practices has played a vital role in\nmitigating risks associated with mining operations. The introduction of safety lamps,\nventilation systems, and safety regulations significantly improved working conditions and\nreduced the occurrence of accidents. Implementing rigorous safety measures, including\nproper training, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and regular inspections,\nreduces the risk of accidents, injuries, and fatalities. While significant strides have been made\nto improve safety standards and reduce accidents, the mining industry continues to face\ninherent risks. Through ongoing efforts, technological advancements, and a collective\ncommitment to safety, the goal remains to achieve Zero Hazard Potential and protect the\nwell-being of miners.\nDirectorate General of Mines Safety (DGMS)\nEntry 55 of the Union List in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India grants\nexclusive legislative authority to the central government over matters related to mines and\nmineral development. This includes the power to enact laws, formulate policies, and make\nregulations concerning mines safety. Under this provision, the central government has\nestablished the Directorate General of Mines Safety (DGMS) as the primary regulatory\nauthority responsible for ensuring mines safety across the country.\nThe DGMS operates under the Ministry of Labour and Employment and is tasked with\nformulating policies, setting safety standards, and conducting inspections to ensure\ncompliance with mines safety regulations. It plays a pivotal role in promoting a safe and\nhealthy working environment in mines by enforcing statutory provisions, issuing guidelines,\nand providing technical expertise.\n1", "source_excerpt": "===PAGE:15===\n1.

The DGMS also conducts investigations into mine\naccidents and takes appropriate action to prevent future occurrences.\nWith the consistent efforts of (i) legislative measures and Actions taken after inspections like\nPointing out contraventions, Withdrawal of permission, Issue of improvement notices,\nProhibition of employment, Informal stoppages, Prosecution in the court of law, and (ii)\nproactive measures/ promotional initiatives a significant improvement in the safety status of\nIndian mines has been achieved. For coal mines, a consistent decline is observed in the 10-\nyearly average number of accidents per year since the 1950s and the 10-yearly average\nnumber of fatalities since the 1970s. The same trend continued for the last 10- yearly period\n2011-2020. For non-coal mines, the average numbers of accidents and fatalities have\nremained more or less at the same level during the period from 1971-1980 to 1991-2000,\nwhile the last ten years' averages during the period 2001-2010 to 2011-2020 have slightly\ndecreased in the number of accidents and fatalities.\nIn addition to inspections and investigations, the DGMS plays a proactive role in creating\nawareness about mines safety through training programs, seminars, and workshops. It\nprovides guidance to mine operators and workers on adopting best practices, using modern\nequipment, and implementing safety protocols to minimize risks and prevent accidents.\nFurthermore, the DGMS actively engages with industry stakeholders, trade unions, and other\nrelevant organizations to gather inputs, address concerns, and promote a collaborative\napproach towards improving mines safety. It regularly reviews and updates safety standards,\ntaking into account technological advancements, industry practices, and international\nbenchmarks.\nThrough its efforts, the DGMS plays a crucial role in protecting the lives and well-being of\nworkers in the mining industry. It strives to create a culture of safety, raise awareness about\noccupational hazards, and ensure that mines operate in compliance with prescribed safety\nnorms.\nDirectorate General of Mines Safety, DGMS in short, is the Regulatory Agency under the\nMinistry of labour and employment, Government of India in matters pertaining to\noccupational safety, health and welfare of persons employed in mines (Coal, Metalliferous\nand oil-mines).

Additionally, the metric of seriously injured cases per serious accident\nprovides valuable insight into the severity of incidents.\nSummary Statistics:\nTotal Years: 10\nTotal Serious Accidents: 2614 Total Seriously Injured Cases: 2733\nMean Serious Accidents per Year: 261.4 Mean Seriously Injured Cases per Year: 273.3\n6", "source_excerpt": "===PAGE:20===\nSerious Accidents\n The highest number of serious accidents as well as seriously injured persons occurred\nin 2013 with 456 serious accidents and 468 seriously injured persons.\n There's a general declining trend in both serious accidents and seriously injured cases\n 2020 had the lowest number of serious accidents and seriously injured cases.\n The decreasing trend in serious accidents and seriously injured cases suggests the\neffectiveness of safety measures over time.

The water shall not be allowed to accumulate over the dumps. Proper\nlevelling of the dumped material should be done.\n12. The back filled area shall be kept benched and the distance of any\nactive mine workings (faces) from the toe of the bottom-most back\nfilled face (bench) shall not be less than 100 m or height of the OB\ndump whichever is higher without prior permission from this\ndirectorate based on scientific study.\n13. The ultimate high wall should be formed by controlled blasting. The\nweak strata should be stabilized and secured adequately.\n14. In case of failed slopes, the new benches should always be formed, in\nthe failed zone, by pushing back the existing pit crest from top\ndownwards. The toe of the failed material should not be touched before\nreforming the benches from top downwards. The fresh benches should\nbe formed in undisturbed slope material.\n15. Most of the high walls and dumps were failed in rainy season. The\nmine management should increase the mine inspections in and around\nthe mine during pre-monsoon period and focus on measures taken for\ndiverting of rain water, drainage system, abnormal flow of water,\ndevelopment of any tension cracks on surface, displacement of\nbenches, etc. There should not be any flow of water over the slopes\nwhich increases density and reduces the cohesion and angle of internal\nfriction of the friable strata leading to the slope failure. Additionally,\ndewatering of potentially unstable zones is also important to minimize\nhazards related to high wall failures. It is recommended to carry out\ngeo-resistivity or any other survey of the mine to locate potential\nsource of ground water around the high wall and use a combination of\nvertical bore wells and horizontal drain holes for depressurization.\nOtherwise the dump would once again get saturated and may lead to a\nfailure. It is recommended to provide adequate & well-planned\ndrainage system in and around the pit in high wall and dump benches\nto maintain the pit/dump slope stable. Proper cleaning/ desilting and\nlevelling of the drains would be necessary to keep the drains effective.\n16.
